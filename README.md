Comorbidity of diabetes and dementia poses a significant public health burden. We modeled the proteomic trajectory from health to obesity, diabetes, mild cognitive impairment, and diabetic dementia, revealing stage-specific dysregulation. Chronic inflammation persists, while kinase signaling and metabolic imbalance mark the diabetes transition.
